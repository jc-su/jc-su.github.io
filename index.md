## Bio
I am a graduate student at Department of Computer Science, [FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.fau.eu/), starting from 2021. Previously I was an undergraduate student from [Shanghai Normal University](https://english.shnu.edu.cn/) and received my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Information Engineering, 2020.

My research interests include Distributed Machine learning Systems, Graph Neural Networks and Deep Learning Compiler. Below are some specific topics I am interested:
* Distributed Large-Scale and Affordable GNN Training
* Scalable Deep Learning Deployment
* Serverless Computing
* Deep Learning Compiler (e.g., TVM, MLIR)
* High Performance Computing Architecture and System
