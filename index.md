## Bio
I am a graduate student at Department of Computer Science, [FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.fau.eu/), starting from 2021. Previously I was an undergraduate student from [Shanghai Normal University](https://english.shnu.edu.cn/) and received my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Information Engineering, 2020.

My research interests include Distributed Machine learning Systems, Graph Neural Networks and Deep Learning Compiler. Below are some topics specifically I am interested:
* Distributed Large-Scale and Affordable GNN Training
* Scalable Deep Learning Deployment
* Edge Cloud Computing
* Deep Learning compiler (e.g., TVM)
* High Performance Computing Architecture and System


## Projects
### Accelerating Neural Network Inference on Nvidia GPU [[Code]](https://github.com/jc-su/NN-Acceleration) [[Presentation]]() [[Report]]()
- Implemented multiple acceleration methods in GEMM and convolution.
- Implemented neural network inference via CUDA.
- Pruned and quantified the model for performance benchmark.

### Deep Learning Compiler and TensorRT acceleration [[Code]](https://github.com/jc-su/tvm_tensorrt_comparsion) [[Presentation]]() [[Report]]()
- Benchmarking TVM kernel level tuning, graph level tuning and cost-model optimazation.
- Tested the optimization effect of the TensorRT deployment model at different precisions.

### Digitizing Jewish Gravestone by Deep Learning Techniques  [[Report]]()
- Proposed a new method combined U-Net and YOLO for gravestone segmentation and text detection.
- Builded a dataset for Jewish tombstone Hebrew text detection and recognition.
