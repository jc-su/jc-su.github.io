## Bio
I am currently a graduate student at Department of Computer Science, [FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.fau.eu/), starting from 2021. Previously I was an undergraduate student from [Shanghai Normal University](https://english.shnu.edu.cn/) and received my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Information Engineering, 2020.

My research aims to improve scalability and efficiency of computer systems with a focus on Machine Learning Systems. Below are some specific topics I am interested:
* Distributed Large-Scale and Affordable DNN Training
* Scalable Deep Learning Deployment
* Serverless Computing
* Deep Learning Compiler (e.g., TVM, MLIR)

## Projects
### Accelerating Neural Network Inference on Nvidia GPU [[Code]](https://github.com/jc-su/NN-Acceleration) [[Slide]](https://github.com/jc-su/jc-su.github.io/raw/main/resources/NN-Acc-Pre.pdf) [[Report]](https://github.com/jc-su/jc-su.github.io/raw/main/resources/RADL_GPU.pdf)
- Implemented multiple acceleration methods in GEMM, convolution, and neural network inference via CUDA.
- Quantization and pruned model for acceleration via TensoRT on Jetson Xavier.

### Deep Learning Compiler for  Neural Network Inference Acceleration [[Code]](https://github.com/jc-su/tvm_tensorrt_comparsion) [[Slide]](https://github.com/jc-su/jc-su.github.io/raw/main/resources/MAP_Project.pdf)
- Benchmarking TVM kernel level tuning, graph level tuning, and cost-model optimization.
- Conducted an in-depth analysis of the pros and cons of the benachmarking results and correlated factors.

### Digitizing Jewish Gravestone by Deep Learning Techniques  [[Report]](https://github.com/jc-su/jc-su.github.io/raw/main/resources/OCR.pdf)
- Implemented multiple acceleration methods in GEMM, convolution, and neural network inference via CUDA; reached theoretical GPU performance with optimized GEMM.
- Utilized TensoRT and Pytorch to realize quantization and pruned model for acceleration, which improved inference performance by 72% while lowered the inference accuracy by only 2.2%.
